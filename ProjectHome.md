pcap2sql is a tool that converts pcap files to a set of relational database tables. Database queries can then serve as a tool for analysis of the captured network data.

The project is at "proof of concept" state, but should be usable enough.

For more information, have a look at the [repository trunk](http://code.google.com/p/pcap2sql/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk) and see the [README](http://code.google.com/p/pcap2sql/source/browse/trunk/README#).
